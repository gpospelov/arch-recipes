# Collection of notes for Arch Linux installation

Repository contains small collection of instructions for Arch Linux installation.
These are simple list of commands which has to be executed in terminal
to install arch, drivers, some necessary packages and fix some annoying
issues.

This is not Yet Another Arch Linux Installation Tutorial, 
but simply some personal memo notes for later reference.
It reflects my own experience/needs with `arch` at the time of `archlinux-2020.01.01`. Close familiarity with [Arch Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) and prior experience with
`arch` installation is necessary to follow.
